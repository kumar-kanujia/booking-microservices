# Repo for a Case study on Movie Booking
- Java
- Spring Framework 
- Spring MVC
- Spring Cloud
- Spring Security

I'm excited to share with you a web application case study that I built for booking movie tickets online. The application is based on the spring framework, which is a popular and powerful Java-based platform for developing web applications. The application uses MongoDB as the database, which is a flexible and scalable NoSQL document store that can handle large amounts of data. The application also leverages cloud architecture, using Api gateway, config server and a naming server like eureka server to provide high availability, load balancing and service discovery. The application also implements spring security to ensure authentication and authorization of users and protect sensitive data. The application allows users to browse, search and book movie tickets from a variety of cinemas and shows.
